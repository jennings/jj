# Sharing branches with others

When

## Assumptions

These guides assume you're using a feature branch workflow:

- Create one or many commits for your changes.
- Push them to the remote with a bookmark to be reviewed.
- Update the bookmark to address review feedback.
- Eventually, the feature branch lands in the trunk. This may be with a real merge, rebase, or a squash merge.

If you follow another process, this information is still applicable but may need
to be adapted for your workflow.

## Getting started

- Push the bookmark
- Track the remote bookmark (automatic)

## Sending updates

## Receiving new commits from others

### Without local changes

Demonstrate that fetching automatically moves the bookmark forward.

### With local changes

Conflicted bookmark, show how to resolve.

## Receiving modified changes

Divergent changes
